			This is a very basic implementation of genetic algorithm .
			
		</p>
		<p>
			Here a random population of rockets learn how to reach a target over several generation through "evolution".
			Each rocket has a DNA and each DNA has a set of genes. The genes tell the rocket how it should fly around . Initially all rockets fly randomly , but the ones that can reach closer to the targets are considered more fit and so have a higher probability to share their genes with the next generation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<h4>
				Eventually after a few generations rockets stop flying randomly and start flying closer and closer to the target .
			</h4> 
			There is also a small amount of mutation in play that randomly mutates some genes when they are being transfered to the next generation.
